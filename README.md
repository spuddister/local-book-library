# Local Book Library Project

I made this project using the MDN Web Docs Express tutorial and The Odin Project as resources. Since my last project, I have learned a massive amount about MVC architecture and other strategies/tools. Some used in this project are listed below.

### New Skills
- Model-View-Controller Architecture
- Express
  - Routes
- Pug Template Engine
- MongoDB
- Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library
- App Deployment on cloud services (Adaptable.io, Railway)
